### Project Overview
---
This Data Analysis Project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an e-commerce company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
  In the initial data preparation phase, we performed the following tasks:
 1.  Data loading and inspection.
 2.  Handling missing values.
 3.  Data cleaning and forecasting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as:
 - What is the overall sales trend?
 - Which prospects are top sellers?
 - What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis 

```sql
SELECT " FROM table1
WHERE cond = 2;
```
### Results/Findings
The Analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable peak during the holiday season.
2. Product category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LIV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target high-LTV customers effectively
  
### Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from the budget and revenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between budget and the number of votes with revenue.
